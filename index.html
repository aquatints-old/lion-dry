<p>Having lived on campus for all of our time in University Park so far, the three of us have found ourselves frustrated when doing laundry.  Depending on where on campus you're living, laundry may be right across the hall from your dorm room, or it could be on a completely different floor.  This is annoying if you are lugging your laundry up the stairs and find when you arrive at the laundry room that there are no open machines.  </p>

<p>We hope we're creating a way to eliminate this frustration.  With Lion-Dry, we are creating a washer/dryer reservation system.  Without going too far into the technical details, the user can sign in with their PSU Access Account to verify they're a student, select their building and floor, and view open machines.  If one is open, they can reserve it for the time it takes them to get to the laundry room. </p>

<a id="what-did-we-make" class="anchor" href="#what-did-we-make" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What did we make?</h2>

<p>We've created a starter demo of the app.  It currently retrieves information on 6 washer and dryer machines stored in a DynamoDB table on Amazon AWS.  It displays whether or not the machine is in use according to that table.  We did not implement the trend graph or the reservation system. </p>
